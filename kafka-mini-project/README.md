## Kafka Mini Project
Building A Streaming Fraud Detection System With Kafka + Python

In this tutorial, we will get our hands dirty and create our first streaming application
backed by Apache Kafka using a Python client. We will try and make it as close as possible
to a real-world Kafka application.
What we'll build is a real-time fraud detection system. We'll do so from scratch. We will
generate a stream of transactions and you will write a Python script to process those stream
of transactions to detect which ones are potential fraud.
